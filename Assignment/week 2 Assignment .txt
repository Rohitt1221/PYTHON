Q2. What are variables in Python? How do you declare and assign values to variables?

	Answer:-
		Variables are containers for storing data values.
		
		To declare and assign values to variables in Python, you use the assignment operator (=). 
		You choose a name for the variable on the left side of the assignment operator, 
		and the value you want to assign to the variable goes on the right side.
		
		Example:-
				variable_name = value
				
Q3.How do you convert one data type to another in Python?
	Answer:-
			You can convert one data type to another using type conversion functions or by using 
			the target data type as a constructor.

			Here are some common methods for data type conversion:
				
				float_num = 3.14
				integer_num = int(float_num)  # Converts float to int
				print(integer_num)  # Output: 3

				string_num = "42"
				integer_num = int(string_num)  # Converts string to int
				print(integer_num)  # Output: 42

				boolean_value = True
				integer_num = int(boolean_value)  # Converts boolean to int
				print(integer_num)  # Output: 1
				
Q4. How do you write and execute a Python script from the command line?

	Answer:-
			 open a command-line and type in the word python , or python3 if you have both versions,
			 followed by the path to your script

Q5. Given a list my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], write the code to slice the list and obtain the sub-list [2, 3].
	
	Answer:-
			my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
			sub_list=my_list[1:3]
			print(sub_list)
			
Q6. What is a complex number in mathematics, and how is it represented in Python?

	Answer:-
			In mathematics, a complex number is a number that comprises a real part and an imaginary part.
			It is written in the form a + bi, where a is the real part and b is the imaginary part.
			The imaginary part is multiplied by the imaginary unit i.
			
			In Python, complex numbers are represented using the complex data type. The imaginary part is 
			denoted by appending j or J to the numeric value
			
			example:-
				# Creating complex numbers
					z1 = 3 + 4j
					z2 = 1.5 - 2.5j

Q7. What is the correct way to declare a variable named age and assign the value 25 to it?

	Answer:-
			age = 25

Q8. Declare a variable named price and assign the value 9.99 to it. What data type does this variable belong to?

	Answer:-
			price = 9.99
			In this case, "price" would indeed be a float variable.

Q9. Create a variable named name and assign your full name to it as a string. How would you print the value of this variable?

	Answer:-
			name = "Rohit Makwana"
			print(name)
			
Q10. Given the string "Hello, World!", extract the substring "World".

	Answer:-
			_string= "Hello , word !"
			sub_string=_string[8:12]
			print(sub_string)
